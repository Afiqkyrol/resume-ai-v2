export const dummyFreeFormInput = `Hi, I’m Jane Doe! I’m a UI/UX designer based in Kuala Lumpur, and I’ve been working in the design field for about five years. I really love creating digital experiences that feel intuitive and engaging. I’m comfortable with tools like Figma, Adobe XD, and Sketch, and I have a basic understanding of HTML and CSS, which helps me communicate better with developers.

Most recently, I worked at Creative Studio as a Senior UI/UX Designer. During my time there, I led a major redesign of our main product which ended up increasing user retention by around 25%. I also enjoyed mentoring a few junior designers and collaborating with different teams to improve overall workflows. Before that, I was at PixelWorks where I designed responsive web and mobile interfaces for multiple clients. That role really helped me sharpen my prototyping and user testing skills.

I graduated with a Bachelor of Design (Graphic & Interactive) from the University of Malaya in 2018. Since then, I’ve continued learning on my own through certifications, including the Google UX Design Certificate and Certified Usability Analyst (CUA).

Some projects I’m really proud of include the TravelMate App, a mobile app I designed from concept to prototype, and the ShopEasy E-commerce redesign, where I improved the checkout flow and helped reduce cart abandonment by about 18%.

In terms of languages, I’m fluent in English and a native Malay speaker. When I’m not designing, I enjoy attending design workshops and keeping up with the latest UI/UX trends.
